		<center><p>Register to be a part of GW's ACM ICPC team.  ICPC is an intercollegiate programming competition hosted by the international ACM group.  Each year, there is a regional competition where teams from each university compete solving programming challenges.  These challenges are similar to CS interview questions and they're very fun!<br /><br />This year, the regionals competition is hosted by Howard University on Saturday, November 5th, 2016.<br /><br />This is a FREE event for any computer science undergrad admitted in GW SEAS.<br /><br />If we meet quota, we will get to Howard University together on the morning of 11/05/2016 and return to campus later that evening.  This is a WHOLE DAY EVENT.<br /><br /><strong><font color="red">REGISTRATION CLOSES ON SEPTEMBER 30th, 2016.</font></strong><br /><br /><strong>*Please note, if you register for ICPC, then you are committing to two things:  you must practice with the GW team for an hour each week leading up to the competition and you must come to the competition in November.*</strong><br /><br />This is an excellent way to practice CS interview questions and become really good at solving them.  Also, the competition is super fun and a great experience.  You also get free food that day, free t-shirts, and free transportation! <br /><br />If you have any questions about ICPC, please contact Neel Shah (<a href="mailto:nshah95@gwu.edu">nshah95@gwu.edu</a>) or Dr. Gabe Parmer (<a href="mailto:gparmer@gwu.edu">gparmer@gwu.edu</a>) and they'll be able to help out.</p></center>

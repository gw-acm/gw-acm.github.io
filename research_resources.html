                <div class="modal-body">
                  <p>I reached out to Dr. Wood during my Software Engineering course after reading one of his networking research papers. No doubt I got my full-time job due to the skills I learned in research. From server administration and python test automation to C network performance research, I've learned more in the last two years than I ever thought possible.
                    I am working in a team of 3 on network security with Docker containers. Our lab works with an Intel platform called DPDK to increase performance with networking data by bypassing the operating system kernel. We are extending this idea to ensure that each application client (or IP address) gets an isolated container to handle their request. This will prevent hackers that break the application from hurting other users on the same server. Hopefully we will write a paper at the end of the semester to publish our results!
                    For younger students, CS professors and students always say that learning throughout your four undergrad years is exponential. Take advantage of every opportunity to learn from people older/more-experienced than you! Joining research was the best educational decision I made in college.

                <div class="modal-body">
                  <p>I was interested in doing research with someone, as it seemed like a good experience. I definitely started earlier than is advised (freshman spring), but I have always preferred practical experience and thought it would be a good way to get some. I started working with Tim because several of the ACM eboard members at the time actively did research with him, and they made a good pitch about the work that he did.
                    I think the big takeaway from doing research with Tim was practical software engineering experience. The way you write code for a class vs. for a proper project are very different, and the way Tim ran his project is very similar to how code is written in industry. This made me way more effective at internships, because I was already familiar with the code review process.
                    Networking experience (the technical kind): given that Tim's lab focuses on networking-related projects, I learned a great deal about how they work. Given how big the internet is, I think it is a really cool aspect of CS to study, and working on ONVM (his big project) gave me a ton of hands-on experience for a subject that can often be very dry.
                    In addition to being a researcher for Tim, I also served as his sysadmin, as he uses a 50-machine Linux cluster in B2 of SEH for his work. This was a fantastic experience, and gave me a ton of practical knowledge about how Linux servers work, and how to run services on them. The experience of running the cluster is what made me choose to be a Production Engineer at Facebook, rather than a regular software engineer.
                    It's also OK to do research and not want to go for a masters or a PhD, it depends on what you like about research (or don't like). Getting a variety of experiences allows you to compare and contrast what you liked about each of them.

                    Ran into Dr. Johnson at a research event, found his stuff interesting, and emailed him. He was super enthusiastic to involve an undergrad, so we set up a meeting and his stuff looked really cool so I started joining the team meetings.
                    I've learned a lot about applying machine learning to a cool interdisciplinary area: computational social science. I've written so much code to apply ML experiments to our unique datasets. I think ML has a stigma of "just Googling stuff" and using prewritten code without really understanding it, but I've read a LOT of papers and written a LOT of my own code. Don't be fooled.
                    I've done a lot of NLP over the last 1.5 years. I was author on a paper for work I did on topic modeling on anti-vaccine Facebook groups. Specifically, we used LDA over a couple different time periods to examine the different trends in topics discussed. This was a really cool project to me and it led into a bunch of other related work on other projects with this research team.

                    Emailed Gabe during sophomore fall about taking one of his classes in the spring, we met to discuss it and I guess why I'd be interested in it, and then he also told me about his research and what he does. It sounded interesting to me so we met again and he explained all the projects and then ended up explaining one of the projects he wanted someone to work on and that became my project.
                    I have definitely learned a lot. It has been pretty difficult -- especially for the first 6 months or so because I literally had no clue what an OS was. Gabe would talk about stuff and I was just so confused all the time. (I still am lol but it was worse then), but it has gotten easier and I've gained a lot of confidence in my own ability. It helped a ton and made OS class a lot less overwhelming than it was for others I think. A lot of what I've learned feels like random/obscure OS stuff but there's also broader skills like being able to dive into a codebase or talk through a mental model or figuring out when to ask for help and when to keep trying to get it on your own. I'm still improving at a lot of this but research has definitely made a big difference for that for me. Also being able to talk about it in interviews definitely helped me get internships this summer lol.
